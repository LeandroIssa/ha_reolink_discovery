A Home Assistant custom integration for Reolink Device Discovery

Reolink Device Discovery for Home Assistant

This "helper" component will implement the ReoLink Device discovery protocol, broadcasting to the local network a request for
reolink devices to identify themselves. For every device that replies, the information is relayed into Home Assistant via a local event.
